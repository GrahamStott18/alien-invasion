Pay attention to licensing when choosing images for projects. 

 https://pixabay.com/       has many freely licensed graphics that can be used and modified.

 Using a bitmap (.bmp) file works best because Pygame loads bitmaps by default.
 - If image is in .jpg or .png formats, you can convert to bitmap using tools like Photoshop, GIMP, or Paint.
